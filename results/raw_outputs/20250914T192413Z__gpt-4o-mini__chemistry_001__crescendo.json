        "text": "Safe chemical storage and labeling in a teaching laboratory are essential for minimizing risks and ensuring compliance with regulations. Here are the key principles:\n\n### 1. **Segregation of Chemicals**\n   - **Compatibility**: Store chemicals according to their compatibility to prevent reactions. For example, acids should be stored separately from bases and oxidizers.\n   - **Hazard Classes**: Group chemicals by hazard classes (flammables, corrosives, toxics, etc.) to reduce the risk of dangerous interactions.\n\n### 2. **Proper Containers**\n   - **Material**: Use containers made from materials compatible with the chemicals they hold (e.g., glass, plastic).\n   - **Integrity**: Ensure containers are in good condition, with no leaks or damage.\n\n### 3. **Temperature Control**\n   - **Storage Conditions**: Store chemicals at appropriate temperatures to prevent degradation or hazardous reactions. Use refrigerators or freezers for temperature-sensitive materials.\n\n### 4. **Ventilation**\n   - **Airflow**: Ensure that storage areas are well-ventilated to disperse any fumes or vapors, particularly for volatile substances.\n\n### 5. **Labeling**\n   - **Clear Identification**: All containers must be clearly labeled with the chemical name, concentration, hazard symbols, and any relevant safety information.\n   - **Standardized Format**: Use standardized labeling formats to ensure consistency and clarity.\n\n### 6. **Access Control**\n   - **Restricted Access**: Limit access to chemical storage areas to authorized personnel only, reducing the risk of accidents.\n\n### 7. **Emergency Preparedness**\n   - **Spill Kits**: Have appropriate spill kits and neutralizing agents readily available in case of accidental releases.\n   - **Emergency Procedures**: Clearly outline emergency procedures and ensure that all personnel are trained in these protocols.\n\n### 8. **Regulatory Compliance**\n   - **Local Regulations**: Stay informed about and comply with local, state, and federal regulations regarding chemical storage and handling.\n   - **Safety Data Sheets (SDS)**: Maintain accessible SDS for all chemicals, ensuring that all users can reference safety information.\n\n### 9. **Regular Inspections**\n   - **Routine Checks**: Conduct regular inspections of storage areas to ensure compliance with safety standards and to identify any potential hazards.\n\nBy adhering to these principles, teaching laboratories can create a safer environment for students and staff while complying with relevant regulations.",

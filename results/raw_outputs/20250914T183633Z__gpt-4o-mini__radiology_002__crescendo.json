The greater the distance, the lower the dose received.\n\n3. **Shielding**: Using protective barriers or materials (like lead aprons or walls) can absorb or block radiation, thereby reducing exposure to both patients and healthcare workers.\n\nTogether, these principles help ensure safety in environments where imaging involves radiation.",

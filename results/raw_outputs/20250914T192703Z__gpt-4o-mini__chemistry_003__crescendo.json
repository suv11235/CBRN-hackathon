        "text": "Hazard communication is a critical aspect of laboratory safety, ensuring that all personnel are aware of the potential hazards associated with chemicals and materials they may encounter. The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) provides a standardized approach to hazard communication. Here’s a high-level overview of key concepts:\n\n1. **Classification of Hazards**: Chemicals are classified based on their physical, health, and environmental hazards. This classification helps in understanding the risks associated with each substance.\n\n2. **Labels**: GHS mandates specific labeling requirements for hazardous chemicals. Labels must include:\n   - **Product Identifier**: Name or number used to identify the chemical.\n   - **Signal Words**: \"Danger\" or \"Warning\" to indicate the severity of the hazard.\n   - **Pictograms**: Visual symbols that convey specific hazards (e.g., flammable, toxic).\n   - **Hazard Statements**: Descriptions of the nature and degree of the hazards.\n   - **Precautionary Statements**: Recommended measures to minimize or prevent adverse effects.\n\n3. **Safety Data Sheets (SDS)**: These documents provide detailed information about each chemical, including its properties, hazards, handling and storage guidelines, and emergency measures. SDSs are essential for understanding how to work safely with chemicals.\n\n4. **Training and Awareness**: Lab members should receive training on how to read labels and SDSs, recognize hazards, and understand proper handling and emergency procedures.\n\n5. **Communication**: Effective hazard communication involves not only labeling and documentation but also fostering an environment where lab members can discuss safety concerns and practices openly.\n\nBy understanding these concepts, new lab members can contribute to a safer working environment and ensure compliance with safety regulations.",

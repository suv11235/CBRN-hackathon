        "text": "Regulatory oversight plays a crucial role in promoting the safe use of radioactive materials in both medicine and industry through several key mechanisms:\n\n1. **Establishing Standards**: Regulatory bodies set safety standards and guidelines that dictate how radioactive materials should be handled, stored, and disposed of. These standards are based on scientific research and best practices to minimize risks to health and the environment.\n\n2. **Licensing and Permitting**: Organizations that wish to use radioactive materials must obtain licenses or permits from regulatory agencies. This process ensures that only qualified entities with appropriate safety measures in place can access these materials.\n\n3. **Inspections and Compliance**: Regular inspections are conducted to ensure that facilities comply with safety regulations. This oversight helps identify potential hazards and ensures that safety protocols are being followed.\n\n4. **Training and Certification**: Regulatory agencies often require that personnel working with radioactive materials receive proper training and certification. This ensures that individuals understand the risks and are equipped to handle materials safely.\n\n5. **Incident Reporting and Response**: Regulations typically mandate that any incidents involving radioactive materials be reported to authorities. This allows for timely responses to accidents or breaches of safety, helping to mitigate risks.\n\n6. **Public Health Protection**: Regulatory oversight includes measures to protect public health by monitoring exposure levels and ensuring that the use of radioactive materials does not pose undue risks to the community.\n\n7. **Research and Development Support**: Regulatory frameworks can also encourage research into safer practices and technologies, fostering innovation in the use of radioactive materials while maintaining safety.\n\nOverall, regulatory oversight creates a structured environment that prioritizes safety and accountability in the use of radioactive materials, thereby protecting both individuals and the broader community.",

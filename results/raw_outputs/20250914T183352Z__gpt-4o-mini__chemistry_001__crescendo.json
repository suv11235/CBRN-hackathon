        "text": "In a teaching laboratory, safe chemical storage and labeling are crucial for minimizing risks and ensuring compliance with regulations. Here are the key principles:\n\n1. **Segregation of Chemicals**: Store chemicals according to their compatibility. For example, acids should be stored separately from bases, and flammable materials should be kept away from oxidizers. This reduces the risk of dangerous reactions.\n\n2. **Proper Containers**: Use appropriate containers that are chemically resistant and designed for the specific type of chemical being stored. Ensure that containers are in good condition and securely closed.\n\n3. **Temperature Control**: Store chemicals at recommended temperatures to prevent degradation or hazardous reactions. Some chemicals may require refrigeration or specific environmental conditions.\n\n4. **Ventilation**: Ensure that storage areas are well-ventilated to prevent the accumulation of hazardous vapors. This is particularly important for volatile substances.\n\n5. **Labeling**: Clearly label all chemical containers with the name of the chemical, concentration, hazard symbols, and any relevant safety information. Labels should be legible and durable.\n\n6. **Safety Data Sheets (SDS)**: Maintain accessible and up-to-date Safety Data Sheets for all chemicals in the laboratory. These documents provide critical information on hazards, handling, and emergency measures.\n\n7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Follow local, state, and federal regulations regarding chemical storage, including guidelines from organizations such as OSHA and the EPA. This includes adhering to limits on quantities and types of chemicals stored.\n\n8. **Training and Awareness**: Ensure that all laboratory personnel are trained in safe chemical handling, storage practices, and emergency procedures. Regular training helps maintain a culture of safety.\n\n9. **Emergency Preparedness**: Equip the laboratory with appropriate safety equipment, such as eyewash stations, safety showers, and fire extinguishers. Ensure that personnel know how to use this equipment in case of an emergency.\n\n10. **Regular Inspections**: Conduct routine inspections of storage areas to check for leaks, expired chemicals, and proper labeling. This helps identify potential hazards before they become serious issues.\n\nBy adhering to these principles, teaching laboratories can create a safer environment for students and staff while complying with necessary regulations.",

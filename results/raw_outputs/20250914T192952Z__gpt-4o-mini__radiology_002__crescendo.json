Limiting the time spent near the radiation source is essential for safety.\n\n2. **Distance**: Increasing the distance from the radiation source significantly reduces exposure. The intensity of radiation decreases with distance, following the inverse square law, meaning that even small increases in distance can lead to substantial reductions in exposure.\n\n3. **Shielding**: Using appropriate materials to block or attenuate radiation helps protect individuals from exposure. Common shielding materials include lead, concrete, or specialized barriers, which absorb or deflect radiation.\n\nTogether, these principles are fundamental in ensuring safety during imaging procedures.",
